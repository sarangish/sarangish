- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarangish
- 👀 I’m interested in people who take time to edit README and think they're awesome, while they're not.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a shitload of full stack tools, so that I can have a job with a decent income.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on several meaningful developer communities, who doesn't have an idea about why they exist.
- 📫 How to reach me? No, I'll reach you if I need.
